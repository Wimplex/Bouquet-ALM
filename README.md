# Bouquet-ALM
</div>


The goal of the Bouquet-ALM project is to create a set of small speech understanding models **with decent reasoning abilities**.

## Naming
:blossom: **Lilac** (small)<br>
Small but mighty ALM with honourable abilities.

:blossom: **Camellia** (tiny)<br>
...

:blossom: **Bluebell** (petite)<br> 
Our smallest model for the youngest researchers.

## To Do
 - [ ] Support a more versatile project structure with the ability to use different encoders.
 - [x] Get rid of embedded Whisper. Load it from hf-hub.
 - [ ] Run training pipeline from the beginning to the end
 - [ ] Create textual reasoning dataset on speech descriptions (*maybe*).
 - [ ] Define best modality adaptation strategy.
 - [ ] Create small set of models.
